# I do not work for a browser vendor!
* Most talks you will find on WebAssembly are biased
* Not saying this is a bad thing, but let's be honest
* Also not trying to compile my C++ game to the web
* I'm an average web developer interested in the future

# A student / teacher perspective on WebAssembly
* I’ve used over 20 different languages and trust me
* Teaching JavaScript is the hardest by far
* ES5 was hard to begin with
* ES6, 7, 8, etc. making it even more difficult

* Language quality race to the top
* More modularity and portability
* JavaScript (maybe) as glue code
* Choose the right tool for the job!
